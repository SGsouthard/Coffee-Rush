/*Things I need for the game to work:
*Main Screen: 
**To be the display screen when the page loads
**To hide when the respective 'How to' and 'Play' buttons are hit

*Instructions:
**To display when the 'How to' is clicked
**to look like the game screen (perhaps imgs?) and highlight each aspect
**to teach how the aspects function in the game

*Game Screen:

**Tips/Score: to add on for each correct order
***(if order is more complex, higher points? total amount of numbers = score?)
****(maybe 4< gets $1.00, 8< gets $2.00, 12< gets $3.00, 16+ gets $4.00)

**Timer: 60 second timer(could change during test phase) counts down.
**The round ends when the timer hits zero.

**Order Window: A text bubble that contains the computers coffee order.
**The format follows "I want (num)Shots, (num)Milks, (num)Sugars, (num)Flavors"
**I'd like the orders to randomize both the variance of the items and the amount.  
**But no more than 5(num)

**Play Buttons: For the buttons to be attractive and responsive
***When the (num) buttons are hit, they have a counter that shows how many they have.
***Also a graphic change to indicate the buttons being hit.
****color change? Maybe gets a tad smaller to indicate pressing down

**Reset Button: For the button to be attractive and responsive.
***lid opens and closes when clicked, the (num) buttons reset too

**Serve Button: For the button to be attractive and responsive.
***Also a graphic change to indicate the buttons being hit.
****color change? Maybe gets a tad smaller to indicate pressing down

**When the timer runs out: The screen changes to the Score Screen

*Score Screen: Have the <h2> update with the players Tip/Score
**To hide to the 'play again' and 'main menu' button responses
